Speaker 1 (Alex): Alright, let's get started. Thanks for joining, everyone. The main goal for today is to finalize the launch plan for the new API Rate Limiting feature. Sam, can you give us an update on the backend?

Speaker 2 (Sam): Yeah, sure. So, the Redis implementation is basically done. I've tested it with about 10,000 concurrent requests, and latency looks good. It's holding up under 50ms. However, I did run into a small edge case where the counter doesn't reset correctly if the server restarts exactly at midnight UTC. I need maybe half a day to patch that.

Speaker 1 (Alex): Okay, that sounds manageable. Do you think you can deploy the fix to staging by tomorrow morning?

Speaker 2 (Sam): Yes, definitely. I'll push the fix tonight.

Speaker 3 (Jordan): From the frontend side, the dashboard UI is ready, but I'm currently blocked. I need the updated API documentation to know exactly what error codes the rate limiter returns. Is it returning a 429 status code with a standard JSON body?

Speaker 2 (Sam): Ah, right. I forgot to update the Swagger docs. Yes, it returns a 429. I'll update the documentation immediately after this call so you're unblocked.

Speaker 1 (Alex): Great. So, Jordan, once you have the docs, how long until we can merge the UI?

Speaker 3 (Jordan): If I get the docs today, I can finish the integration tomorrow and we can do a full end-to-end test on Thursday.

Speaker 1 (Alex): Perfect. Let's aim for that. So, to recap: Sam is fixing the midnight bug and updating docs today. Jordan finishes UI integration tomorrow. We aim for a code freeze on Thursday and release on Friday morning. Does that work for everyone?

Speaker 2 (Sam): Works for me.

Speaker 3 (Jordan): Sounds good.

Speaker 1 (Alex): Awesome. Thanks, everyone. Let's break.
